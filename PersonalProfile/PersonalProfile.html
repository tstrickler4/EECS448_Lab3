      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Bruce Wayne.<br>
        When I was young, I witnessed the death of my parents at the hand of a mugger. That day, I swore an oath to defend the Gotham City from such evils as that which took my parents' lives.<br>
        When I was 14, I began training in martial arts under several great instructors: Henri Ducard, who taught me man-hunting; Kirigi, a ninja who taught me stealth and reconnaissance; the Ghost Tribes of the Ten-Eyed Brotherhood, African bushmen who taught me how to hunt; Ted Grant, a world champion boxer, who taught me hand-to-hand combat; David Cain, who taught me the ways of an assassin; Nepalese monks who taught me traditional healing; Oliver Queen, who taught me archery; and Harvey Harris, a detective who greatly improved my detective skills.<br>
        Now, every night I dress up as a bat and fight crime as my alter ego: BATMAN!
